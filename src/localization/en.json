Most of my experience is in building scalable applications and APIs while making sure the systems are up running and stable. \n\n Even though my main focus is Backend and Full-Stack, I am also comfortable deploying and maintaining solutions on the cloud. \n\n When I'm not coding, you'll find me on my motorcycle exploring new routes, strategizing over board games or pushing my limits in the gym."
